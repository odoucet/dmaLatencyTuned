dmaLatencyTuned
===============
Power consumption is based on C-States.

You can adjust kernel response time - and accordingly CPU consumption - by writing to /dev/cpu_dma_latency

Why this tool ? 
---------------
By experience, default timings are too aggressive in current kernel, and CPU goes to C6-state too often, leading to
a less responsive server. I personnally found a 40% difference performance on some benchmarks !
I wrote this tool after exposing my problem on kernel mailing list here : http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1425277

How it works
------------
This tool monitors /proc/stat and write to this file to get the most effective value : 
- if CPU is idle, allow C6/C7, and then change based on load.
- When CPU is heavily used, stay in C0

To see C-States / dma_latency value relationship : 

```
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state*/{name,latency}
```
